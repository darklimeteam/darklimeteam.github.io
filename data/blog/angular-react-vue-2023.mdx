## Why do I need Module Federation?

The subject of this article is to go through the technical implementation of
injecting React and Vue remote modules into an Angular shell app using Webpack 5's
ModuleFederationPlugin. This plugin allows dividing an app into remotely loaded
modules, also known as a Microfrontend approach. But why do we need Microfrontends?
Let's consider a scenario where different apps have a `PROFILE` page where users can
view and edit their personal data, and a `SETTINGS` page. We might consider
the possibility of separating these pages from the main app and loading them
asynchronously from remote sources.

Let’s think about possible scenario of module federation preference over monolit.
In this particular case, using module federation with Microfrontends might be a good
choice for a few reasons:

1. Delegating the development of the `PROFILE` and `SETTINGS` modules to a standalone
   team allows them to work independently and potentially at a faster pace.
2. If the main app uses a different framework or version of the framework, using
   module federation allows the `PROFILE` and `SETTINGS` modules to be developed and
   maintained independently, even if they use a different framework.
3. If the app is large, using module federation can help break it down into smaller,
   more manageable pieces, making it easier to upgrade one module at a time without
   affecting the rest of the app.
4. Deploying the `PROFILE` and `SETTINGS` modules separately from the main app allows
   for more flexibility and faster deployment times, as the main app does not need to be
   rebuilt and redeployed every time a change is made to one of these modules.

If you want to learn more about Module Federation and related concepts, the list of
useful links at the end of the article can be a great resource. Alternatively, if
you want to see how an Angular, React, and Vue sample works, we can go through that
as well.

Let’s start from scratch. 3 folders should be created (see below).

In our case, we consider Angular app as a shell, and `PROFILE` together
with `SETTINGS` as the remote modules.

The next two sections are about React and Vue remote modules
development.

## React PROFILE remote module

Let’s start with the React PROFILE module implementation. Its source code could be
found [here](https://github.com/darklimeteam/module-federation-angular-react-vue/tree/main/react-component).
It contains a quite simple form where user can edit his name and email. Implementation
is very simple. One thing you should pay attention on: `bootstrap.js` file is
mandatory, because of a bug described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71228191/shared-module-is-not-available-for-eager-consumption-angular-13).

To run this app do the next in the app folder:

```js:
yarn
yarn start
```

After that you may see the next form in your browser (port 3001):

![http://localhost:3001](/static/images/3an.png)

Let’s make a closer look at ModuleFederationPlugin settings in the `webpack.config.js`
file

```js:webpack.config.js
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'profile_user',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './ProfileReactComponent': './src/ProfileReactComponent',
      },
      shared: {
        react: {
          singleton: true,
          requiredVersion: deps.react,
          eager: true
        },
       'react-dom': {
         singleton: true,
         requiredVersion: deps['react-dom'],
         eager: true
       }
      },
    }),
```

Here ReactProfileComponent was exposed, react libs were shared.
Note that all imported code, like listed in `profile-style.css`
will be included in exposes module together with the
ReactProfileComponent.tsx.

### Vue SETTINGS remote module

Vue source code could be found [here](https://github.com/darklimeteam/module-federation-angular-react-vue/tree/main/vue-component).

To run Vue app do the next in the app folder:

```js:
yarn
yarn start
```

![http://localhost:3002](/static/images/4an.png)

ModuleFederationPlugin settings in the `webpack.config.js` file of Vue
SETTINGS component looks like the next

```js:webpack.config.js
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
     name: 'settings_user',
     filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
     exposes: {
       './Settings': './src/components/Settings'
     },
     shared: {
       vue: {
         eager: true,
         requiredVersion: deps.vue,
       },
     },
   }),
```

defidefineCustomElement from Vue 3 is used to avoid React & Vue conflict
in Angular shell app. defidefineCustomElement allows to build Vue component
as an isolated element into the shadow-dom.

###Angular shell with the remotes
Let’s use React PROFILE module and Vue SETTINGS module as the remotes into `angular-shell`.

The question is when remotes should be loaded into the Angular shell app.
The answer really depends on the requirements of the particular app. In
our case, React and Vue components should appear on the homepage of Angular
shell app, so `LoadRemoteModule` methods run as a part of the app initialization
process.

```js:angular-shell/src/app/app.module.ts
export function initializeApp(): () => void {
 return () => {
   loadRemoteModule({
     remoteEntry: "http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js",
     remoteName: "profile_user",
     exposedModule: "./ProfileReactComponent",
   });
   loadRemoteModule({
     remoteEntry: "http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js",
     remoteName: "settings_user",
     exposedModule: "./Settings",
   });
 };
}

@NgModule({
 declarations: [AppComponent],
 imports: [BrowserModule, RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
 providers: [
   {
     provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
     useFactory: initializeApp,
     multi: true,
   },
 ],
```

Pay attention on webpack.config.ts, here in WebpackFederationPlugin
section remotes appear again. Next to them - shared React libs to allow
`angular-shell` be a federated module by itself.

```js:angular-shell/webpack.config.ts
new container.ModuleFederationPlugin({
     name: "angular-shell",
     filename: "remoteEntry.js",
     remotes: {
       profile_user: `profile_user@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js`,
       settings_user: `settings_user@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js`,
     },
     shared: {
       react: {
         singleton: true,
         requiredVersion: deps.react,
       },
       "react-dom": {
         singleton: true,
         requiredVersion: deps["react-dom"],
       },
     },
   }),
```

Webpack devServer headers with `"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"`
allows to avoid CORS error.

`angular.json` file should be modified to replace angular default webpack
config by our custom one. See changes [here](https://github.com/darklimeteam/module-federation-angular-react-vue/commit/d9e7d0f09f5f6b3cd6b903f4618d1a07d936ddf1).

Let’s finally move to React component injection into Angular one.
`profile-user.component.ts` has been created as container that utilized
React component. ProfileReactComponent has been loaded asynchronically
in `ngAfterViewInit`. `decl.d.ts` has been created to tell Angular that
“profile_user” is valid import directory.

```js:angular-shell/src/app/profile-user/profile-user.component.ts
ngAfterViewInit() {
    this.root = createRoot(this.containerRef.nativeElement);
    this.root.render("Loading script...");
    try {
      import("profile_user/ProfileReactComponent").then((val) => {
        this.root.render(
          React.createElement(val.ProfileReactComponent, {
            ...this.user,
            onClick: this.updateCurrentUser,
          })
        );
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("Erorr", error);
    }
  }
```

React PROFILE component interacts with Angular shell by onClick function
usage. As a result of the name and email submitting in React component,
Angular shell app invokes updateCurrentUser to change this data in
`app.component`.

Vue SETTINGS component is injected into `settings.component.ts` wrapper.
Approach is very similar to React PROFILE one. ngAfterInit from
`settings.component.ts` listed below

```js:angular-shell/src/app/settings/settings.component.ts
import("settings_user/Settings").then((val) => {
       this.renderer.appendChild(
         this.containerVueRef.nativeElement,
         new val.default()
       );
     });
```

That's it. Let’s run Angular shell app. Note the use of yarn. This is
required to override the webpack version for the angular cli. In
`angular-shell` folder run the next commands:

```js:
ng new --skip-install
ng config cli.packageManager yarn
yarn install
```

The app starts using port 4201.
![http://localhost:4201](/static/images/1an.png)

What the next?

You might have noticed that a Vue component doesn't send data to the
Angular shell. A Vue custom element uses the Shadow DOM to
encapsulate component behavior, so the best approach in this case is
to use an external store to get and put data through the microfrontend
apps. This approach is the subject of the next article.
